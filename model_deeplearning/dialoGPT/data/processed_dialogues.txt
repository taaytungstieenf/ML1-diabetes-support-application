See you. <|user|> Have a nice day, bye. <|bot|> Bye bye. <|user|> Hi, what are you going to do today? <|bot|> I'm going to the mountain. <|user|> Be careful if you are going to walk a lot, you may need to decrease your insulin dose. <|bot|> Yes, I will decrease my insulin dose and I will also eat some cookies before leaving. <|user|> Well done, but it is possible that you need to check your glucose level during the day. <|bot|> Ok, but what should I do if my blood glucose level is low? <|user|> You should always have sugar in your bag in case your blood glucose drops. <|bot|> Does it have to be sugar? <|user|> No, you could also drink a juice with enough amount of carbohidrates. <|bot|> Great, that is all I need to know. <|user|> Enjoy your day on the mountain. <|bot|> I will, bye! <|user|> See you later. <|bot|> Hello, how are you? <|user|> I am feeling stressed lately. <|bot|> What is making you feel that way? <|user|> I have a very important exam today and I cannot fail. <|bot|> Have you studied for the exam? <|user|> I was studying all this week for my exam and I think this affected my blood glucose. <|bot|> Why do you say that? <|user|> I couldn't control my blood sugar level very good this week, it was always high. <|bot|> Did you change yor diet or insulin dose? <|user|> No, I kept them the same as usual. <|bot|> The stress from the exam is probably causing this rise in your glucose level. <|user|> Will it improve after I finish my exam? <|bot|> The glucose level will surely improve after you finish. <|user|> I hope so. <|bot|> See you, bye. <|user|> See you. <|bot|> How are you feeling today? <|user|> Hey, I am not feeling right. <|bot|> How come? <|user|> I think I got a virus and I have stomachache. <|bot|> Did this affect your glucose levels? <|user|> Yes, I think so. My glucose is abnormally high since my stomach started hurting. <|bot|> This is normal, you should rise your insulin doses until you get better. <|user|> All right, I hope this helps me to have a better glucose control. <|bot|> Anyways, it should improve after you heal from the stomachache. <|user|> I hope I heal soon. <|bot|> I hope so too. Bye. <|user|> bye. <|bot|> Hey, what did you do yesterday? <|user|> I spent the whole day chilling and I went to a fancy restaurant for dinner. <|bot|> Nice! What did you order? <|user|> I had a big steak with french fries and a cheesecake for dessert. <|bot|> Sounds delicious. Did you have to inject a big dose of insulin? <|user|> Yes, I injected 15 units of fast action insulin. <|bot|> I see, the fries and the cheesecake have a lot of carbohidrates. <|user|> I had a good level of blood glucose two hours after dinner, but this morning I woke up quite high. <|bot|> What was your blood glucose level this morning? <|user|> 245, a bit higher than I would like. <|bot|> It's difficult to maintain always a good blood glucose level. Are you gonna do something to improve it? <|user|> I'm going for a walk in the park now. <|bot|> Great, enjoy your walk. <|user|> You enjoy your day too, bye. <|bot|> Hi!!! <|user|> What's up? <|bot|> I am very excited! I have a date this afternoon. <|user|> What are you gonna do? <|bot|> We are going to do ice skating. <|user|> That sounds great! <|bot|> Yes, and after skating we will get some pizzas. <|user|> Hmmm I love pizza, but remember pizza has a high amount of carbohidrates. <|bot|> I know, but it shouldn't affect my sugar level that much because I will skate this afternoon. <|user|> Don't forget to measure your blood sugar level one hour and a half after dinner. <|bot|> I will, just in case I have to correct my insulin dose or eat more carbohidrates. <|user|> Enjoy your date. <|bot|> Thanks! I will tell you how it ends. <|user|> Goodbye! <|bot|> See you soon. <|user|> Good morning! <|bot|> Hey, it's nice to see you here again. How are you? <|user|> I woke up low today. <|bot|> Oh, that's sad. Did you eat some sugar to recover? <|user|> No, I had an orange juice and now I am feeling fine. <|bot|> That's great. Do you know why this happened? <|user|> I think I calculated my dinner insulin dose incorrectly. <|bot|> You can also try to calculate more precisely the carbohidrate amount in your dinner. <|user|> Yes, I will try to eat more next time. I have to go, I'll talk to you later. <|bot|> Have a nice day, goodbye. <|user|> See you. <|bot|> Hey, I have amazing news to tell you. <|user|> You seem very excited. What's the matter? <|bot|> I am going to get married next Sunday!!! <|user|> Congratulations! Are you ready for the day? <|bot|> Yes, but I feel very nervous because I still have things to prepare for the wedding. <|user|> I think the wedding is gonna be great, so you shouldn't overthink it. <|bot|> Yes, but it is inevitable. I think it is also affecting my glucose levels. <|user|> Have you noticed a rise in your glucose levels lately? <|bot|> Exactly. <|user|> Then let's hope everything works out great. <|bot|> Thank you very much! See you. <|user|> Talk to you later, bye. <|bot|> Good night. <|user|> Hi. <|bot|> What are you doing? <|user|> Not much, I am lying in the sofa watching a movie with some popcorn. <|bot|> That sounds like a great plan to me. <|user|> Well, I wanted to go out with friends for dinner because I stayed the whole day at home. <|bot|> Let me guess. Your friends were not free today? <|user|> You got it right. <|bot|> And how was your glucose today? A lack of exercise tends to increase the glucose levels. <|user|> Yes, they were a bit high, but I really wanted to have some popcorn. <|bot|> You should increase your insulin dose if you want to have a good glucose level. <|user|> I am going to put insulin right now, thanks for the advice. <|bot|> No problem, I hope you enjoy the movie. <|user|> Thanks, talk to you tomorrow. <|bot|> Have a good night! <|user|> Hey, how are you doing? <|bot|> Fine, but I could be doing better. <|user|> How come? Did something happen? <|bot|> Every morning I wake up with my sugar a bit high, even if I went to bed with a good sugar level. <|user|> It could be related to the carbohidrate amount in your dinner. <|bot|> No, I don't think so. I eat different food and inject my insulin dose accordingly, but after four or five hours my sugar increases. <|user|> Did you change your insulin type or your lifestyle? <|bot|> I had a leg injury and I've stopped doing sport, and in the past I used to do a lot. <|user|> That could be the cause behind your rise in glucose. <|bot|> Yes, I suppose so. Should I increase my insulin dose? <|user|> You probably should increase the dose, but speak with your doctor first. <|bot|> Thanks, I will contact my doctor to solve this problem. <|user|> Great, have a nice day. <|bot|> You too, bye! <|user|> Hi, are you awake? <|bot|> Yes, I am. What's the matter? <|user|> I just woke up in the middle of the night and I cannot sleep again. <|bot|> Did you check your glucose level? <|user|> I didn't think about that, I will check it right now. <|bot|> Okay, I will wait here. <|user|> My blood glucose level is 56, so I am a bit low. <|bot|> You should eat 5g of sugar or a fast acting glucose like a fruit juice. <|user|> Yes, I will eat something now. How did you think about the glucose level? <|bot|> When you wake up in the middle of the night and you cannot sleep even though you are tired is because your body is not ok. <|user|> Nice to know. Next time I will check my glucose for sure. <|bot|> Great, but be careful. You may need to eat something else. <|user|> Yes, I will also eat a banana. Thanks. <|bot|> You're wellcome. Good night. <|user|> Good night. <|bot|> How was your afternoon? What did you do? <|user|> Oh hi! My afternoon was amazing, I went to a rock concert with my girlfriend. <|bot|> That is really cool. <|user|> Yes, and we also had some beers during the concert. It was amazing. <|bot|> That sounds really good. <|user|> Yes, but now my glucose level is a bit high. <|bot|> Could this be related to the beers? <|user|> I am sure that is the cause. I also danced in the concert, so I didn't put any insulin during the concert. <|bot|> Seems that the exercise you did while dancing in the concert wasn't enough to lower your glucose level. <|user|> No, so now I have to inject some insulin. <|bot|> Be careful. Even if you have high glucose right now, you still did some exercise and it could affect your glucose later. <|user|> Well thought!! I will decrease my insulin dose a little bit. <|bot|> Okay, but don't forget to check your glucose level one and a half hours after the insulin injection. <|user|> Don't worry, I will. <|bot|> Great to hear. Have a good night. <|user|> You too, good night. <|bot|> Hey, what are you doing right now? <|user|> Hi, I just finished cooking the lunch for today. <|bot|> What did you prepare? <|user|> I cooked a whole turkey in the oven with some potatoes. <|bot|> It sounds delicious. I assume you are not gonna eat a whole turkey alone? <|user|> Of course not! I am inviting my family for lunch. <|bot|> I hope you have a wonderful lunch. Don't forget to inject a correct dose of insulin, potatoes have a lot of carbohidrates. <|user|> Yes, I already thought about that, so I will increase my insulin dose today. <|bot|> Fantastic. Don't forget to measure your blood glucose level one hour and a half after your lunch. <|user|> I will set an alarm so I don't forget about that. My family is coming, so I have to leave you now. <|bot|> Enjoy your lunch with your family. Bye. <|user|> Thank you, goodbye. <|bot|> Hi, how are you? <|user|> Everything fine. And you? <|bot|> I'm very tired today. <|user|> What did you do? <|bot|> I worked all day in a storehouse packing material and moving boxes. <|user|> Wow, it seems you had an exhausting day. Could you control your glucose fine? <|bot|> I measured my glucose before lunch and I was quite good, at 85. However, I didn't check it again since then. <|user|> You should check it again now, you did a lot of exercise. What did you eat for lunch? <|bot|> I had a salad and a steak with potatoes, and I injected 5 units of fast action insulin. <|user|> You should check your glucose level again now, maybe you didn't eat enough carbohidrates. <|bot|> It seems I didn't, I am at 46 now. What should I eat? <|user|> Since no fast action insulin is acting now, you should improve only by having 5 g of sugar or 200 cl of juice with sugar. <|bot|> Ok I will go to eat now. See you later. <|user|> See you, goodbye. <|bot|> Hey, how is your day going? <|user|> Not bad, and yours? <|bot|> I'm also fine, but somehow I don't feel quite well. <|user|> Oh, I'm sorry. Why is that? <|bot|> Because no matter how much water I drink, I still feel thirsty. <|user|> That is a common symptom of having a high blood glucose level. Have you checked it? <|bot|> No, I didn't check it. I actually drank a beer one hour ago, could this be affecting my glucose? <|user|> Yes, that beer is definetely the cause for your thirst. However, you should check your glucose. <|bot|> Ok, I did check it and I was at 320, quite high. I'm gonna put some fast action insulin to be good again. <|user|> Yes, but measure your insulin dose carefully or you may get down on blood glucose. <|bot|> I have injected 7 units of insulin. I hope the thirst disappears soon. <|user|> I'm sure it will. Think about this the next time you drink a beer. <|bot|> Sure I will, thanks for your help. <|user|> You're welcome, you can contact me anytime you feel like this. <|bot|> See you later, bye. <|user|> Goodbye. <|bot|> Hi, how are you feeling today? <|user|> My head is a bit dizzy. I think my glucose is low. <|bot|> I think so too, you should eat something to raise your glucose. <|user|> I was thinking about eating some cheese. <|bot|> Cheese is tasty, but it's not the best thing for you right now. You have to eat a bit of sugar, or a juice. <|user|> Ok, but I really want to eat cheese. <|bot|> Then you should eat the cheese with some bread, it will also help to raise your glucose. <|user|> I will do that. <|bot|> But first you should drink a juice, it will make you feel better. <|user|> Ok, I will drink a juice and eat bread with cheese. <|bot|> Right, but be careful with the bread, too much could raise your glucose too much. <|user|> I will only have a slice of bread. <|bot|> Perfect, enjoy your food. <|user|> Thank you, bye. <|bot|> Hey, how are you? <|user|> I'm fine, and you? <|bot|> Also fine. What are you doing? <|user|> I have just finished cooking my dinner. <|bot|> What did you cook for dinner? <|user|> I grilled chicken breast and also cooked some rice. <|bot|> That sounds good, but do you know that rice has a lot of carbohidrates? <|user|> Yes I do, so I will inject a higher than usual dose of insulin. <|bot|> Great, but don't forget to measure your blood glucose level one hour and a half after your insulin injection. <|user|> I will measure it, because last time I didn't do it and my glucose rose higher than I wanted. <|bot|> You have to be careful with some food like potatoes, rice or pasta. <|user|> Yes. I will leave now, my chicken will cool if I wait more. <|bot|> Okay, enjoy your dinner. Talk to you tomorrow. <|user|> Ok, goodbye. <|bot|> Hello, how are you? <|user|> I'm great, and you? <|bot|> Quite bad, my blood glucose is really high. <|user|> You should inject insulin to reduce your blood glucose. <|bot|> I know, but I'm going to a football match now and I don't want to have a low glucose level during the match. <|user|> But if you don't inject insulin it is possible that you have a high glucose for a long time, and you won't feel good. <|bot|> Ok, then what should I do? <|user|> You should speak with your doctor to be certain on what to do. <|bot|> Yes, I will speak with him and try to improve my blood glucose level. <|user|> I hope you win your football match. <|bot|> I hope so too. See you later. <|user|> Bye, see you soon. <|bot|> Hello! <|user|> Hey, what's up? <|bot|> I'm very nervous. What about you? <|user|> I'm fine. Why are you so nervous? <|bot|> I have a very important exam this afternoon and I cannot fail. <|user|> Have you studied for your exam? <|bot|> Yes, I have studied but I haven't been able to control my glucose lately. I fear to be low during my exam. <|user|> How is your blood glucose level now? <|bot|> It is good, 92. But I don't know if it will reduce until my exam. <|user|> Maybe you could eat something with low carbohidrate amount to raise a little bit your blood glucose. <|bot|> Yes, I want to do that but I don't know what to eat. <|user|> Maybe a small biscuit or some fruit, no more than 5g of carbohidrates. <|bot|> Great, I will eat a small banana then. <|user|> Enjoy your banana and good luck on your exam. <|bot|> Thank you, see you later. <|user|> Later. <|bot|> Hey!! <|user|> Hello, how are you feeling today? <|bot|> Great, and you? <|user|> I feel horrible today. Yesterday I had a big party and today I have hangover. <|bot|> If you feel really bad, you could take an ibuprofen. How was your party? <|user|> It was great, we played some drinking games, ate some pizzas and danced till the morning. <|bot|> It sounds amazing. Did you check your glucose during the party? <|user|> No, I checked it before going to bed and I was quite high, so I had to inject insulin. <|bot|> And what was your glucose level when you woke up? <|user|> I was still high, but I should be fine. <|bot|> Did you inject your slow action insulin? <|user|> I should have, but I don't really remember if I injected during the party. <|bot|> That could explain why you woke up high. You should speak with your doctor to know what you should do. <|user|> Yes, I will. At least this will make my hangover better. <|bot|> Definetely. I hope you get better soon. <|user|> Thanks, talk to you later.
